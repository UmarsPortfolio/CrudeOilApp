Topping Allied's bid of 4.80 New Zealand dollars a share ($2.12) would have been too expensive, Gordon Cairns, Lion Nathan's chief, said yesterday. After the transaction, Allied will hold 70 percent of Montana, and Lion Nathan will make 127 million New Zealand dollars ($56.2 million) on the sale of its stake. Lion Nathan has identified other opportunities in the wine business, Mr. Cairns said. \u00a0\u00a0Becky Gaylord (NYT) EUROPE FINLAND: SETBACK FOR SAMPO Sampo, Finland's largest insurer, suffered a setback in its $2.3 billion bid for its Norwegian rival Storebrand, when Norwegian regulators refused to lift a rule that requires financial companies to acquire more than 90 percent of a target's outstanding stock. Only 86.3 percent of Storebrand investors have turned over their shares to Sampo, not enough to secure a deal under the requirements. The Norwegian government was widely expected to enforce the rule, in part because it did not want the country's largest insurer to fall into foreign ownership. Den Norske Bank, Norway's largest bank, has hindered the deal by refusing to sell its almost 10 percent stake in Storebrand to Sampo. \u00a0\u00a0Suzanne Kapner (NYT) FRANCE: TEST FLIGHT FOR CONCORDE Air France took a Concorde jet for a test flight for the first time since one crashed into a hotel shortly after takeoff on July 25, 2000, killing 113 people.

The company said its profit was 1.05 billion euros ($960 million) in the first half, down from 1.1 billion euros a year ago.
