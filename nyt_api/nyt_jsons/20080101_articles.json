Believe it or not, this was an economic crisis that affected people who didn\u2019t happen to be pinstriped bankers, hedge-fund managers or cabinet officials. You didn\u2019t have to read the stock-market columns to know it was happening. Ordinary people started walking to town or skipping errands \u0097 taking the compact and not the S.U.V. Actually, I did that. And then, the price of oil plummeted, first because of slowing demand and recently amid panic selling during the credit crisis. And as it plunged more than 40 percent from its record high of $147 a barrel, the issue has faded.

Why? The cynic in me says it's the predictable plunge just before our national elections (you can look it up). What better way to remove gas prices as a campaign issue? Afterward we can brace ourselves for the post-election price surge.  But could something more be happening here? Could the oil industry finally have killed the goose that laid the golden eggs?  \"Demand destruction\" is an economic term that is being used with greater frequency when it comes to worldwide oil-pricing strategies.  \"Basically, demand destruction occurs, or begins to occur, when prices become perceived as too high,\" said Dr. Peter Wells, an oil-industry analyst, at a sustainable mobility seminar last month organized by Toyota. \"At a certain price people start changing their purchase decisions \u2013 permanently.\"  It's a situation that the oil industry has studied and worried about with increasing frequency in recent years, Mr. Wells said.  For instance, automakers could finally say, \"We're done riding the gas price roller coaster. From now on, we're building electric cars.\" That would be a manifestation of demand destruction \u2013 a fairly sobering manifestation of it, from the standpoint of the oil industry.  Oil pricing strategies traditionally have been based on the law of supply and demand \u2013 or some variation of it. Prices are pushed as high as they possibly can be, until, say, truckers start barricading highways, motorists picket gas stations and Congress schedules hearings. Then prices retreat a bit until tempers cool, and then prices resume climbing.  Over the past year, a spike in oil prices has been blamed on several factors: increased demand from developing countries, stock market speculation, Hurricane Ike, political unrest and, of course, the old oil industry stand-by: greed.  Crude oil prices hit a record $147.27 a barrel on July 11. Gasoline prices hit a record of $4.11 a gallon six days later, according to the American Automobile Association.  Sales of gas-guzzling vehicles plummeted. Motorists grounded themselves. Rush hour in Los Angeles became almost tolerable.  Since then, however, oil prices have been dropping faster than a television set tossed out of a rock star's penthouse.  Crude oil hit $70 a barrel last week, and industry analysts have predicted prices as low as $60. It's almost as if the oil industry is saying, \"We're sorry. We didn't mean it. We want you back.\" (Actually, ministers of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have called an emergency meeting on Nov. 18 to revisit pricing strategies.)  Through all of this, sales of gas-guzzlers have yet to recover. Motorists have stayed put. And automakers seem to have decided the secret to getting them going again \u2013 and buying again \u2013 is to build a new generation of vehicles that use little, if any, gasoline.  At the recent Paris Motor Show, manufacturers presented a parade of dozens of electric, hybrid and alternative-fuel vehicles \u2013 the likes of which the industry has never seen.  Is this the dawning of a new era? Or just another day in the life of the old one? Just to be safe, I am going to fill up all my vehicles before Election Day.

In his Rose Garden speech, Mr. Bush briefly noted a planned boost in fuel-mileage standards for vehicles and technologies that might move the country away from petroleum in coming decades. But the four prongs of the speech were not about using less fuel, but boosting supplies: drilling offshore, extracting oil from shale, drilling on the coast of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and adding refineries.  In discussing oil shale, Mr. Bush made a fresh effort to get Democrats in Congress to consider unlocking the vast deposits of the Green River Basin, saying the cost of production is low enough to make such supplies competitive at current prices. But he didn't mention the non-monetary costs, which include the enormous amount of energy required to heat the rock and resulting carbon dioxide emissions if that energy comes from fossil fuels.   Mr. Bush's statement is included below. I encourage you to weigh in on particular assertions, either supporting or challenging them. (Joe Romm at Climateprogress.org has already noticed an Energy Department study projecting that offshore drilling wouldn't have an impact on oil production or prices before 2030.)

EDT  THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. I want to thank Secretary Kempthorne and Secretary Bodman for joining me. For many Americans, there is no more pressing concern than the price of gasoline. Truckers and farmers and small business owners have been hit especially hard. Every American who drives to work, purchases food, or ships a product has felt the effect. And families across our country are looking to Washington for a response.  High oil prices are at the root of high gasoline prices. And behind those prices is the basic law of supply and demand. In recent years, the world's demand for oil has grown dramatically. Meanwhile, the supply of oil has grown much more slowly. As a result, oil prices have risen sharply, and that increase has been reflected at American gasoline pumps. Now much of the oil consumed in America comes from abroad -- that's what's changed dramatically over the last couple of decades. Some of that energy comes from unstable regions and unfriendly regimes. This makes us more vulnerable to supply shocks and price spikes beyond our control -- and that puts both our economy and our security at risk.  In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. We've mandated a large expansion in the use of alternative fuels. We've raised fuel efficiency standards to ambitious new levels. With all these steps, we are bringing America closer to the day when we can end our addiction to oil, which will allow us to become better stewards of the environment.  In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production. Unfortunately, Democrats on Capitol Hill have rejected virtually every proposal -- and now Americans are paying the price at the pump for this obstruction. Congress must face a hard reality: Unless Members are willing to accept gas prices at today's painful levels -- or even higher -- our nation must produce more oil. And we must start now. So this morning, I ask Democratic Congressional leaders to move forward with four steps to expand American oil and gasoline production.  First, we should expand American oil production by increasing access to the Outer Continental Shelf, or OCS. Experts believe that the OCS could produce about 18 billion barrels of oil. That would be enough to match America's current oil production for almost ten years. The problem is that Congress has restricted access to key parts of the OCS since the early 1980s. Since then, advances in technology have made it possible to conduct oil exploration in the OCS that is out of sight, protects coral reefs and habitats, and protects against oil spills. With these advances -- and a dramatic increase in oil prices -- congressional restrictions on OCS exploration have become outdated and counterproductive.  Republicans in Congress have proposed several promising bills that would lift the legislative ban on oil exploration in the OCS. I call on the House and the Senate to pass good legislation as soon as possible. This legislation should give the states the option of opening up OCS resources off their shores, provide a way for the federal government and states to share new leasing revenues, and ensure that our environment is protected. There's also an executive prohibition on exploration in the OCS. When Congress lifts the legislative ban, I will lift the executive prohibition.  Second, we should expand oil production by tapping into the extraordinary potential of oil shale. Oil shale is a type of rock that can produce oil when exposed to heat or other process[es]. In one major deposit -- the Green River Basin of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming -- there lies the equivalent of about 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil. That's more than three times larger than the proven oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. And it can be fully recovered -- and if it can be fully recovered it would be equal to more than a century's worth of currently projected oil imports.   For many years, the high cost of extracting oil from shale exceeded the benefit. But today the calculus is changing. Companies have invested in technology to make oil shale production more affordable and efficient. And while the cost of extracting oil from shale is still more than the cost of traditional production, it is also less than the current market price of oil. This makes oil shale a highly promising resource.   Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress are standing in the way of further development. In last year's omnibus spending bill, Democratic leaders inserted a provision blocking oil shale leasing on federal lands. That provision can be taken out as easily as it was slipped in -- and Congress should do so immediately.  Third, we should expand American oil production by permitting exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR. When ANWR was created in 1980, Congress specifically reserved a portion for energy development. In 1995, Congress passed legislation allowing oil production in this small fraction of ANWR's 19 million acres. With a drilling footprint of less than 2,000 acres -- less than one-tenth of 1 percent of this distant Alaskan terrain -- America could produce an estimated 10 billion barrels of oil. That is roughly the equivalent of two decades of imported oil from Saudi Arabia. Yet my predecessor vetoed this bill.  In the years since, the price of oil has increased seven-fold, and the price of American gasoline has more than tripled. Meanwhile, scientists have developed innovative techniques to reach ANWR's oil with virtually no impact on the land or local wildlife. I urge members of Congress to allow this remote region to bring enormous benefits to the American people.  And finally, we need to expand and enhance our refining capacity. Refineries are the critical link between crude oil and the gasoline and diesel fuel that drivers put in their tanks. With recent changes in the makeup of our fuel supply, upgrades in our refining capacity are urgently needed. Yet it has been nearly 30 years since our nation built a new refinery, and lawsuits and red tape have made it extremely costly to expand or modify existing refineries. The result is that America now imports millions of barrels of fully-refined gasoline from abroad. This imposes needless costs on American consumers. It deprives American workers of good jobs. And it needs to change.  So today I'm proposing measures to expedite the refinery permitting process. Under the reformed process that I propose, challenges to refineries and other energy project permits must be brought before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals within 60 days of the issuance of a permit decision. Congress should also empower the Secretary of Energy to establish binding deadlines for permit decisions, and to ensure that the various levels of approval required in the refinery permitting process are handled in a timely way.  With these four steps, we will take pressure off gas prices over time by expanding the amount of American-made oil and gasoline. We will strengthen our national security by reducing our reliance on foreign oil. We will benefit American workers by keeping our nation competitive in the global economy -- and by creating good jobs in construction, and engineering, and refining, maintenance, and many other areas.  The proposals I've outlined will take years to have their full impact. There is no excuse for delay -- as a matter of fact, it's a reason to move swiftly. I know the Democratic leaders have opposed some of these policies in the past. Now that their opposition has helped drive gas prices to record levels, I ask them to reconsider their positions. If congressional leaders leave for the 4th of July recess without taking action, they will need to explain why $4-a-gallon gasoline is not enough incentive for them to act. And Americans will rightly ask how high oil -- how high gas prices have to rise before the Democratic-controlled Congress will do something about it.  I know this is a trying time for our families, but our country has faced similar strains before and we've overcome them together -- and we can do that again. With faith in the innovative spirit of our people and a commitment to results in Washington, we will meet the energy challenges we face -- and keep our economy the strongest, most vibrant, and most hopeful in the world.

Demand is so high for drilling ships that builders have raised prices up to $100 million per vessel since 2007. (Woohae Cho/Penta Press for The New York Times)) [UPDATE 7/25: More on Arctic oil and the environment.] The U.S. Geological Survey has released the first Arctic-wide estimate of undiscovered natural gas and oil deposits and come up with huge numbers for both, at least on first glance. The region north of the Arctic Circle, the agency said, probably has a third of the world's remaining uncharted gas and 20 percent of the remaining oil.   But as Jad Mouawad notes in The Times, if that amount of oil were extractable, it would still add up to less than three years' worth of gasoline, heating oil and other petroleum needs at today's consumption rate of 86 million barrels a day -- and the demand for oil is rising. The gas is a much bigger deal, with Arctic-wide estimates equaling the known reserves for Russia, the world's largest largest gas source.  The Arctic energy report, then, perhaps supports the assertions of those saying that the world will not be able to drill its way out of the oil crunch in the long run, and that, with or without considering global warming, we must eventually shift to electrified transportation and renewable farmed fuels for sectors like aviation that can't plug in.  (Photo: The drill rig aboard the Deepwater Millennium works in seas up to 10,000 feet deep. Rising oil prices are driving ever more costly exploration. (Credit: Lori Waselchuk for The New York Times).) As for petroleum, while increased scarcity and demand will spur people to drive less, in smaller cars, it will also guarantee the expansion of drilling farther toward the ends of the Earth and  deeper in ocean basins. Drilling there is ridiculously hard, and costly, so it will be the last place to be sucked dry. Just review how hard it was simply to extract one 1,200-foot-long core of sea bed near the North Pole in 2004.   That economic reality is why even James Hansen of NASA, perhaps the most impassioned scientist pressing for cuts in fossil fuel burning, bases his best-case calculations for greenhouse emissions around the presumption that a lot of the world's extractable oil will eventually be burned. (He seeks a rising carbon tax to slow the pace of oil use. [UPDATED, 7/24, 12:30: Dr. Hansen said my initial wording didn't reflect his views well. His comment is below. In a followup note Dr. Hansen put his views on Arctic oil this way: \"We should not be going to the ends of the Earth for the last drop -- that is the behavior of a crazed addict -- we should move on to the post-fossil-fuel-era.\"]   This all means that our Big Melt series from 2005 and my New York Times book, \"The North Pole Was Here\", still hold up as portraits of a polar region forever changed from an untouchable, frozen frontier to just another human-dominated part of Earth -- for better and worse.

Will there be more?.", "lead_paragraph": "(Photo: ) On Tuesday, I wrote that one of the advantages of biodiesel made from algae is that it can be easily piped -- unlike ethanol, which is transported by other means.  Matt Hartwig, a spokesman for the ethanol industry, wrote to remind me that ethanol can in fact be piped.  As my colleague Clifford Krauss wrote recently, Kinder Morgan, a big pipeline company in Houston, had been testing a pipeline in Florida in October.   Last week, that pipeline -- the only ethanol pipeline in the country, according to Kinder Morgan -- went into service.   The company is now piping ethanol over 85 miles from Tampa to Orlando, after spending $10 million to upgrade the line to handle ethanol as well as gasoline. Midwestern ethanol arrives at Tampa by rail or barge -- or by boat from South America -- and is then sent onward.  Why don't more ethanol pipelines exist? The trouble is that ethanol -- which is an alcohol -- can corrode and crack pipes, requiring special additives. In addition, water can often seep into pipeline systems, damaging the fuel in ways that don't affect gasoline.      As a policy paper last year from the Association of Oil Pipelines and the American Petroleum Institute points out, the economics are also iffy, partly because ethanol plants are relatively small and dispersed.  Despite such challenges, a far longer pipeline is being contemplated.   Magellan and Buckeye, two other pipeline companies, are studying whether they can bring fuel-grade ethanol 1,700 miles from Iowa to New York Harbor.  In an e-mail message, Bruce Heine of Magellan, wrote: \"We are currently working on (1) options for federal financing and (2) meeting with prospective shippers to gauge their interest in the project.\"  A tax barrier to ethanol pipelines, outlined in this article, was resolved in the bailout bill in early October.   Ethanol is also at a disadvantage on the piping front, Mr. Hartwig noted, because most of it is produced in the middle of the country and shipped to the coasts, whereas most fuel pipelines run in the opposite direction, bringing oil and gas inland.   At the moment, he said, most ethanol is shipped by rail \u2013 the main alternatives being truck and barge.

He called on his Democratic rival to join him back at work.", "lead_paragraph": "Updated LAFAYETTE HILL, Penn. -- Come back, Barack.   While some Republican members of the House are having a jolly time in Washington trying to embarrass the Democrats into returning to Congress to pass an energy bill, Senator John McCain on Monday issued a personal challenge to his Democratic rival to \"come back into town and come back to work.\"   Mr. McCain, the presumed Republican nominee, urged Congress to abandon its five-week summer recess and return to the Capitol to address the nation's energy needs.   \"Congress should come back into session,\" Mr. McCain said after touring the National Label Company, in Lafayette Hill, a suburb of Philadelphia, according to a pool report. \"I am willing to come back off the campaign trail.\"   He then went on to challenge Senator Barack Obama, the presumed Democratic nominee, to meet him in Washington so Congress can move forward on a package of measures to increase the oil supply and develop new sources of energy. Referring to an \"energy crisis,\" he mentioned offshore drilling and nuclear power as measures to help the nation achieve energy independence.   \"I hope that Senator Obama will call on Congress and the leaders Harry Reid and Speaker Pelosi to call Congress back into session,\" he said. \"Let's get this energy crisis solved.\"  Mr. McCain, of Arizona, made the remarks shortly after Mr. Obama, of Illinois, delivered a speech on energy in Michigan, calling the nation's \"addiction to foreign oil\" \"one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced.\"  He laid out a program to reduce dependence on foreign oil and impose a tax on oil companies to provide energy rebates to American families \u2013 a proposal he said Mr. McCain would not support because he is too close to the oil companies. (\"He raised more than $1 million from big oil just last month, most of which came after he announced his plan for offshore drilling in a room full of cheering oil executives,\" Mr. Obama said in his speech. \"His initial reaction to the bipartisan energy compromise was to reject it because it took away tax breaks for oil companies.\")  The McCain campaign pointed out that Mr. Obama also received contributions from oil company executives -- $400,000, they said.  In Washington, meanwhile, some Republican House members were engaged in a lively show of theatrics to send a signal to gas pump-challenged Americans that they are ready to address the soaring gas prices and other rising energy costs \u2013 if only the Democratic-controlled Congress did not leave town before a bipartisan package of proposals was approved. Several hung around the Capitol, on the Monday after Congress had dispersed, to march in front of television cameras and chide the Democratic leaders.   Mr. McCain, who has served in Congress for 26 years, has missed numerous votes on crucial legislation, particularly during this prolonged campaign. But he said he was ready to return to session and criticized Congress for \"doing nothing.\"   \"I call on Senator Obama to call on Congress to come back into town and come back to work,\" he said. \"Come off their recess. Come off their vacation and address this energy crisis for America and don't leave until you do. Republican and Democrat joining together. And a very vital part of that is nuclear power. And another vital part of that is offshore drilling.\"  Mr. McCain has been pressing for Congress to approve a measure that would allow states to decide whether they would allow offshore drilling \u2013 a plan that he once described as merely \"psychological relief\" at a time of record oil and gas prices, but which nonetheless has some popularity with the American people, according to some recent public opinion polls.   Mr. Obama has been opposed to expanding offshore drilling, saying it would not provide any new oil for at least seven years, while perpetuating America's dependence on the nonrenewable energy source. But over the weekend, he said he would accept an offshore drilling provision as part of a larger package of measures to increase the energy supply if its inclusion was the difference between a bill being passed by Congress and not. Today in Michigan he also said that the government should sell 70 million barrels of oil from its strategic petroleum stockpile to help reduce gasoline prices.  Mr. McCain delivered his remarks, and took no questions, after touring the labeling company and holding a private business round table, according to the pool report.   He then boarded his campaign plane and headed for Sturgis, S.D., home of the famous motorcycle rally, to attend its tribute to veterans and members of the military. According to the Web site for the Sturgis rally, he will be speaking at the Buffalo Chip Campground, where Kellie Pickler, an \"American Idol\" contestant class of 2006, and Kid Rock, will perform.    Update &#124; 7:37 p.m.: \"If Senator McCain is willing to pass a compromise that provides immediate relief to consumers in the form a $1,000 energy rebate and makes a serious investment in renewable energy, Senator Obama would be happy to join him in calling on Congress to return,\" Bill Burton, Obama campaign spokesman, said. \"But if he continues to reject any compromise that takes away tax breaks for the same oil companies that have given millions to his campaign, as he did on Friday, we'd rather not waste the American people's tax dollars,\" said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton.

An image from a McCain campaign fund-raising e-mail.  And it hasn't ended yet. We'd joke that it hasn't run out of gas yet, but we'd be accused of getting carried away with the puns here.   This morning, the McCain and the Obama camps and their respective party surrogates were at it again. To the Republicans, tire-inflation harkens back to the days of Jimmy Carter and the energy crisis of the 1970s.  To the Obama campaign, the advice seems pretty much an accepted point -- and its staff spent part of the morning spinning out releases in a way that seemed energetic even for the slow news days of August.   They quoted two Republican governors, Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Charlie Crist of Florida; the U.S. Department of Energy; and no less than the authorities of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, or NASCAR, as touting the wisdom of proper inflation.  Now how did the proper weight of tires come into the realm of poli-speak? Energy has been a big piece of the candidates' campaigns recently. Mr. Obama, in Lansing, Mich., Monday, released an energy plan calling for rebates for consumers and deeper commitments to renewable energy, as well as other measures. Mr. McCain has his own plan, but has recently highlighted his support for lifting full out the ban on off shore drilling. (Mr. Obama of late has shifted his position to say that he would accept a compromise that would allow for some off shore drilling and to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.)  But back to the original rollout of the tire issue:  Last week, while criticizing Mr. McCain's plan, Mr. Obama mentioned that the average American could save as much money by keeping a car's tires filled with air as drilling for oil would reap in savings.   Asked about that suggestion, Mr. McCain replied: \"He suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas,\" Mr. McCain said. \"My friends, let's do that, but do you think that's enough to break our dependence on Middle Eastern oil? I don't think so. So I believe that every energy source needs to be part of the solution. We need to develop new alternative energies like wind, solar, tide, biofuels, but we also need to develop more existing energies like nuclear power and clean coal.\"  This morning, the Republicans announced that their gift on Senator Obama's birthday (he turned 47 today) was a tire gauge that they would send to the media to represent the Democrat's energy plan. Well, we guess they want to make sure we all keep our tires inflated properly -- at least until November.  Update: And this afternoon as we were writing this item, Rick Davis, the McCain campaign manager, sent out a fund-raising appeal offering guess what in exchange for at least a $25 donation to the Republican's presidential coffers? Your very own  tire gauge, embossed with the words \"Obama Energy Plan.\"  So now you can be a McCain donor and save (according to the Department of Energy via the Obama campaign) about 3.3 percent on your gas mileage if you check your tires regularly.

When Freeplay\u2019s windup radio came out in 1996, it set the standard for eco-tech purity. Originally meant to deliver information to isolated populations lacking electricity, the Freeplay was a shortwave radio that ran only on human power. Thirty seconds of winding time produced 40 minutes of listening time. And now it\u2019s starting to gain allies in its heretofore lonely battle against the battery (which Americans currently consume at the rate of three billion a year). An Idaho start-up called M2E Power is in the forefront of kinetically charged consumer electronics. Having just secured $8 million in venture capital, M2E (\u201cmotion to energy\u201d) expects to introduce a biomechanical-energy harvester within 12 to 14 months \u0097 a device about the size of an iPhone that, when carried by a \u201clow-active person\u201d during the course of a couple of days, will generate a charge sufficient to power your cellphone for an hour or two. The ultimate aim is a self-charging cellphone. Bad news for the battery industry, yes \u0097 but M2E isn\u2019t all about moon-eyed idealism: half of its business model is devoted to military applications. Sony\u2019s Odo products, on the other hand, are a line of toys \u0097 camera, music player, etc. \u0097 that run when you crank, twirl or shake them. There are, alas, no plans to sell them. But when they started appearing at future-design shows this year, they resonated deeply with trend bloggers, an influential and conflicted group that is dedicated to ecological correctness but also likes really cute gadgets. No less fantastic is the equally conceptual Bamboo Phone imagined by the Dutch designer Gert-Jan van Breugel. Powered by a hand crank and made of bamboo, it also contains seeds, so a tree will shoot up in the landfill where it\u2019s buried. WM.
