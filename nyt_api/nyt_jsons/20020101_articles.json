Over six days, as cracks amidships lengthened, more than 2.5 million gallons of oil leaked from the Bahamas-registered Prestige before it finally split in two and sank 100 miles offshore on Tuesday. Debate intensified in Europe over accelerating what is a decade-plus process of phasing out tankers with unlined hulls, like that of the 26-year-old Prestige. The ship -- owned, managed, chartered and registered in four different countries -- had passed inspections earlier in the year. But officials and environmentalists said that single-layer hulls, particularly those over a quarter-century old, lack sufficient strength to carry oil safely. For the moment, there were no signs that the 17-million gallons of oil inside the bow and stern sections, which sank two miles to the sea bed, was headed to the surface.

Died at his home in El Dorado, Arkansas March 20, 2002. His wife, Johnie Walker Murphy, preceded him in death; surviving him are: four children; Michael Walker Murphy, Martha Wilson Murphy, Charles Haywood Murphy, III, and Robert Madison Murphy; three sisters, Theodosia Murphy Nolan, Caroline Murphy Winter, and Bertie Murphy Smith; and eight grandchildren. He was born in El Dorado March 6, 1920, the son of Charles Haywood Murphy, Sr. and Bertie Wilson Murphy. Charles Murphy is best remembered as an oilman. His father had him manumitted by court order at the age of sixteen so he could legally transact business for himself, and he entered the petroleum industry on his own as an independent while still in his teens. At the age of twenty-one he assumed full managerial responsibility for his family's business, consisting primarily of oil production, farming and timber lands scattered across Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. For the next fifty-three years (except for three years' service in the U.S. Army infantry during World War II) he devoted his considerable energy to building this business into an international oil company that has been active on every continent except Antarctica. It is now a public company, of which the family still owns some 25%, and it still bears the family name, Murphy Oil Corporation. It is ranked by Fortune and Forbes magazines on some of their various measures as from the 312th to the 370th largest industrial concerns in the United States. Charles Murphy served this organization, under various titles, as its Chief Executive Officer until 1986 and continued as Chairman of the Board until 1994. While building Murphy Oil, Charles Murphy did not forsake his heritage as a banker. He succeeded his father as a major shareholder and dominant force in the First National Bank of El Dorado, which later became part of a group of banks owned by First United Bancshares, which Charles Murphy served as Chairman of the Board. This group of banks has now been succeeded by BancorpSouth Banc. Additionally, Murphy was a major investor in First Commercial Corporation, a significant regional bank holding company, where he served as Chairman of the Executive Committee. First Commercial has now become part of Regions Bank. Less public attention has been focused on Charles Murphy's career as an educator and philanthropist. This is the way he wanted it. He served seventeen years on the Arkansas Board of Higher Education, where he was instrumental in beginning the drive to improve the quality of public education in Arkansas. At the same time, he was dedicated to the improvement of private education as well, and gave generously of his time and money in this cause. He served ten years as a trustee of Hendrix College, where he and his family established the Hendrix Murphy Foundation, providing financial support to the institution. He also served on the Board of Administrators of Tulane University, where he and his family established the Tulane Murphy Foundation and the Murphy Institute of Political Economy. The Murphy Foundation, established by Charles Murphy, his wife, and his mother, provides financial support to both public and private institutions of learning, as well as scholarships to enable students to pursue higher education. For his service in the field of education, Murphy was recognized with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Arkansas in 1966. (continued next column)     Charles Murphy's service to education did not consist only of serving on boards and giving money. He was active as a teacher and lecturer, without fee, on a broad range of subjects, to a variety of audiences. Examples of the breadth and scope of his lectures include: ''The Effect of Environment on Business Strategy'' given at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, ''Energy Alternatives for the Mid21st Century'' at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., and ''Reading, Writing, and Thinking'' at El Dorado High School, El Dorado, Arkansas. That he was able to deal with such a range of subjects is due not only to his powerful intellect, but also to the manner of his education. His classroom education ended with his graduation from High School at Gulf Coast Military Academy at the age of sixteen, but his education continued throughout his life. As a young person he was taught languages, philosophy, history and science in the classical way by tutors, and as an adult he pursued his education by prodigious reading. Charles Murphy is recognized as a scholar by other scholars. Mrs. Arnold Toynbee, widow of the renowned historian, once introduced him as the only person who ever changed her husband's mind. Charles Murphy's public service encompassed more than the field of education. He served his country and his industry and often sought to bridge gaps between different points of view. He served ten years on the National Petroleum Council, including as its Chairman. The Council was established by the United States Government during World War II as a group of leading oilmen to advise the government on matters pertaining to strategic petroleum supply. He also served for ten years and chaired the American Petroleum Institute Conservation Liaison Committee. This committee laid the groundwork for some of today's far reaching petroleum industry environmental programs. For his service he received a citation for Outstanding Individual Service to Natural Resource Management from the National Wildlife Federation. Charles Murphy served his industry through membership on the American Petroleum Institute Board of Directors and its Executive Committee and Management Committee. This group honored him with election as President of its prestigious 25 Year Club and an honorary life membership on the Board of Directors. He was also instrumental in the founding of the National Ocean Industries Association, representing many diverse interests in the use and conservation of ocean resources. Like other facets of his life, Charles Murphy's public service board memberships reflect a broad range-in addition to those already mentioned, he has served on the Board of Governors of the Oschner Medical Foundation, the National Advisory Board of the Smithsonian Institution and the Louisiana Governor's Council on Economic Development. Charles Murphy was at ease with people from all walks of life, from Presidents and Prime Ministers, Kings and Princes, to roughnecks and roustabouts and service station attendants, and he was invariably courteous and charming to all. He was a citizen of the world, with friends and acquaintances in every part of the globe, but he never forgot his roots, his friends included Sam Rayburn, Lyndon Johnson, H. L. Hunt (and his family), Lloyd Bentsen and George Bush, of Texas; Russell Long, John McKeithen, Jimmy Noe, and Bennett Johnston, of Louisiana: Robert Kerr, Dean McGee, Carl Albert, and David Boren, of Oklahoma; and Witt and Jack Stephens, Chesley Pruet, John L. McClellan, William Fulbright, Wilbur Mills, Oren Harris, Sam Walton, Robert E. Lee Wilson, Dale Bumpers, David Pryor, Ray Thornton, Jay Dickey, Bill Clinton and Mike Huckabee, of Arkansas. He was on personal terms with every President of the United States from Truman to George W. Bush and his acquaintanceships extended to such diverse contemporary historic figures as James Schlessinger, Lady Margaret Thatcher and the Shah of Iran. When he discovered an oil field on tribal Indian land in Eastern Montana, he was inducted into the Assiniboine-Sioux Tribe and made a honorary chief, and he accepted this honor with the same grace as he accepted an honorary LLD from the University of Arkansas, the Roughneck of the Year Award from the American Petroleum Institute 25 Year Club, and an invitation to conduct a petroleum economics seminar for the National Iranian Oil Company following the Iranian Revolution. He responded with equal courtesy and thoughtfulness to requests for advice from Presidents, Cabinet Secretaries, OPEC Oil Ministers, and the widows of former employees. Charles Murphy left his mark on the times in which he lived. His son Madison said ''The world is left a much duller place by his passing.''", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/24/classified/paid-notice-deaths-murphy-charles-h.html", "snippet": "", "lead_paragraph": "MURPHY -Charles H., 82.

The son of Lucille Eagle and Richard Owen, was born August 24, 1903 and passed away on April 28, 2002, in the town of his birth. He was the great-great grandson of Robert Owen, the Welsh social reformer and owner of the celebrated textile mills in New Lanark, Scotland. Robert Owen purchased the town of New Harmony in 1825, creating a Utopian community in the hope of bringing educational, and social opportunities to every man, woman and child. Kenneth Owen spent his youth in New Harmony but graduated from Memphis Central High School, where he lettered in varsity basketball and track, breaking the interscholastic high jump record in 1922. He earned a degree from Cornell in 1926, moved to Houston in 1927 and worked as a field geologist in Texas during the 1920's for The Humble Oil Company. Pursuing the innovative and pioneering career of his forebear, David Dale Owen, the First Indiana State Geologist, K D, discovered a highly productive oilfield that became the financial basis for his formation of two successful Houston based companies, Gulfshore Oil Company and Trans-Tex Production Company. Mr. Owen's financial enterprises allowed him to pursue other life time passions. With the help of Wayne Haygood, Indian Mound Farm, in New Harmony became one of the top purebred Hereford cattle breeding operations in the world. His scientific mind and discriminating eye enabled him to become one of the most respected standard-bred breeders in the country, winning the coveted Hambletonian in 1967. In the late 80's when he retired from the Hambletonian Society it was said ''During the 45 years that Ken Owen has been in harness racing, he has not only set new standards as a breeder, but he has also symbolized the brightest form of sportsmanship and integrity our sport has known.'' Mr. Owen took an active interest in restoring properties originally owned by his family in New Harmony. The house, in which he was born, the David Dale Owen Laboratory, was his New Harmony home. He also restored the RappMaclure-Owen Mansion and the Rapp Granary. The Granary was headquarters for pioneer geologic investigations during the Owen community endeavors from 1825-1860. He was one of seven founding members of the New Lanark Association, Ltd. In Scotland, an organization restoring the original Robert Owen industrial properties. Mr. Owen is a member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, a Legion of Honor member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, The American Petroleum Institute, The Houston Geological Society, The American Hereford Association-Honor Gallery Award, and The Trotting Horse Hall of Fame Museum. He was an emeritus member of the Cornell University Council, Equine Advisory Council of the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine, and he held an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Southern Indiana. Mr. Owen was appointed Tennessee Ambassador of Goodwill by Governor Sundquist, commissioned a Colonel by the State of Kentucky and awarded Indiana's highest honor as a Sagamore of the Wabash by Governor Frank O'Bannon. He was married to Jane Blaffer of Houston Texas for 61 years. He was the adored father of three daughters: Jane Dale Owen, Anne Dale Owen, and the late Caroline Owen Coleman, and the grandfather of Ingrid Arneberg, Erik Owen Arneberg, James Owen Coleman, Abigail Owen-Pontez, and great-grandfather to Sarah. While Kenneth Dale Owen has been acknowledged for a multitude of distinguished achievements he will be most remembered for being a gentle man to the very end. All who knew him will miss his honesty, his keen eye, his dry wit, his innate since of fairness and his love for all living creatures. The family would like to thank all those whose care and concern allowed Kenneth Owen to live life to its fullest. The funeral will be held in New Harmony, Indiana on Thursday, May 2nd and the date for the Memorial Services in Houston, Texas is pending.
