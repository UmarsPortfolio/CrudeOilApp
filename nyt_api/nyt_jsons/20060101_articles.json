she reshaped Nigeria's economic policies. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, left, a former World Bank vice president, was finance minister for three years and was instrumental in negotiating a deal to use the windfall Nigeria received from oil prices to build a $30 billion reserve account and pay off billions of dollars in foreign debt at a cut rate. She was recruited by President Olusegun Obasanjo to burnish Nigeria's image, particularly with international financial institutions, and was the most powerful in a clique of officials charged with battling rampant corruption. Then in June she was appointed foreign minister, an ostensibly prestigious post largely unconnected to her economic training, though she retained the portfolio of shepherding the economy. That responsibility was transferred to another official this week. A government statement said Ms. Okonjo-Iweala was resigning to attend to \"pressing family issues.\" LYDIA POLGREEN (NYT)", "print_section": "A", "print_page": "7", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "World Briefing | Africa: Nigeria: Economy Czar Resigns", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "World Briefing | Africa: Nigeria: Economy Czar Resigns", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Nigeria", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Okonjo-Iweala, Ngozi", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Suspensions, Dismissals and Resignations", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Appointments and Executive Changes", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Credit", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2006-08-04T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Foreign Desk", "section_name": "World", "byline": {"original": "By Lydia Polgreen (NYT)", "person": [{"firstname": "Lydia", "middlename": "Polgreen", "lastname": "NYT", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/0f2e5d03-1c3c-5f47-b5fe-e5c470eebe7a", "word_count": 167, "uri": "nyt://article/0f2e5d03-1c3c-5f47-b5fe-e5c470eebe7a"}, {"abstract": "Big oil has been pressing Congress for years to expand its rights to drill for domestic offshore oil and gas, with little to show for its efforts.

S. Campaign in Iraq  A man identifying himself as Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the head of Al Qaeda in Iraq, appeared in a video posted on a Web site calling the American effort in that country a ''crusader'' campaign and denouncing the efforts to form a new Iraqi government.    A1    Sanctions in Darfur Violence  The United Nations Security Council, in the first sanctions in the violence that has killed more than 200,000 people in Darfur, passed a resolution banning travel by four Sudanese accused of war crimes.    A10    Egyptians React to Bombings  As the Egyptian police began to round up suspects in the triple bombing of a resort on the Sinai peninsula, many Egyptians expressed fear that the attack would destroy the tourist industry.    A6    9 Killed in Sri Lanka Attack  A Tamil rebel suicide bomber attacked a Sri Lankan military headquarters, killing at least 9 people and wounding at least 27, bringing the cease-fire accord between the government and the rebels closer to collapse.    A10    Iran Considers Nuclear Sharing  Iran's supreme leader said at a meeting with the Sudanese president that Iran was ready to share its nuclear technology with other countries, the news agency IRNA reported.    A6    Rice Addresses Turkish Fears  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice assured Turkish leaders that the United States would step up efforts to stop Kurdish insurgents in Iraq from infiltrating into Turkey, but she cautioned the Turkish government not to send troops to Iraq to do the job.
