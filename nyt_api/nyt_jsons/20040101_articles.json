Having pared costs nearly as much as possible, \"the big job airlines have to do to survive is to reduce fuel consumption,\" Mr. Boyd said. \"New fuel-efficient airliners will be a survival necessity.\" Embraer's fuel-efficient line of regional jets with 80 to 150 seats stands to gain popularity at the expense of smaller regional jets with 50 or fewer seats, he said. Boeing's existing 737-600 line and the 7E7 long-range jet it is developing should also fare well, he said. In its annual fleet forecast, the Boyd Group projected that 1,000 7E7's could eventually be sold, while demand for wide-body aircraft will continue to wane. At the same conference, Ray Neidl, an airline analyst with Calyon Securities, predicted that oil prices were accelerating the timetable for major changes in the industry. Most of the network airlines \"are trading close to bankruptcy levels, so the markets are trying to tell us something,\" he said.

Sen John Kerry accuses Pres Bush of breaking vow that oil from Iraq would lower oil prices to $28 barrel (S)", "lead_paragraph": "After crude oil prices reached $50 a barrel on Tuesday and held at that price yesterday, Senator John Kerry accused President Bush of breaking a vow that oil from Iraq would lower oil prices to $28 a barrel. \"The president promised us the oil would pay for the war, but we know that those oil pipes are being blown up,\" Mr. Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, said in Madison, Wis. \"We know that $50 a barrel isn't as bad as it might get because analysts are now telling us that the price may go up to $60.\" He added, \"The average American is going to feel this pain. Haliburton's not feeling the pain. The people in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East, who get the money aren't feeling the pain.\" In response to similar comments by Senator John Edwards, Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, on Tuesday said the rising oil prices reflected a failure of Senate Democrats to approve the president's energy plan, and on the recent hurricanes, brushing off the notion of the Iraq war's influence. \"What happens here is that we go through this year after year because we manage through patchwork crisis management instead of passing comprehensive solutions,\" Mr. McClellan said.", "print_section": "A", "print_page": "23", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "WORDS ON OIL", "kicker": "THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: CAMPAIGN BRIEFING -- THE DEMOCRATS", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "THE 2004 CAMPAIGN: CAMPAIGN BRIEFING -- THE DEMOCRATS; WORDS ON OIL", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Iraq", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Bush, George W", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "Kerry, John", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "United States International Relations", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTION ISSUES", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Prices (Fares, Fees and Rates)", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Terrorism", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Presidential Election of 2004", "rank": 9, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE", "rank": 10, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2004-09-30T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "National Desk", "section_name": "U.S.", "subsection_name": "Politics", "byline": {"original": "By David M.

But big hub airports like Los Angeles International, Houston Intercontinental and Dallas-Fort Worth International will also lose a small number of daily flights, said Ed Stewart, a Southwest spokesman. ''Philadelphia is certainly one of the places where we are growing faster than any of our other city openings in recent history,'' he said. Other city-pair routes on which Southwest will add flights include: Hobby Airport at Houston and Orlando, Fla.; Houston Hobby and Los Angeles; Baltimore and Nashville; Chicago Midway and Tampa, Fla.; Las Vegas and Tucson, Ariz.; and St. Louis and Oklahoma City. Joe Brancatelli, the publisher of the business-travel Web site JoeSentMe.com, said Southwest's move made sense. ''It's what smart airlines do,'' he said.

The company said its weaker results were caused by the weakness of the dollar relative to the euro and the rise of hydrocarbon prices, among other factors.", "print_section": "C", "print_page": "3", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "World Business Briefing | Europe: France: Russian Oil Stake Considered", "kicker": null, "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "World Business Briefing | Europe: France: Russian Oil Stake Considered", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "Russia", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Yukos", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Sibneft", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Total SA", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CASTAIGNE, ROBERT", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline", "rank": 7, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Company Reports", "rank": 8, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2004-05-08T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Ariane Bernard (NYT)", "person": [{"firstname": "Ariane", "middlename": "Bernard", "lastname": "NYT", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/737a5ef8-ff23-5ecb-a14a-8b01d57d6e51", "word_count": 168, "uri": "nyt://article/737a5ef8-ff23-5ecb-a14a-8b01d57d6e51"}, {"abstract": "British Airways reports fourth-quarter pretax profit of 45 million pounds ($80 million) compared with loss of 200 million pounds year earlier; full-year income rose 70 percent, to 230 million pounds ($407 million); chief executive Rod Eddington warns rising fuel costs could affect future profits; photo (S)", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/18/business/world-business-briefing-europe-britain-airline-s-profit-rises.html", "snippet": "British Airways reports fourth-quarter pretax profit of 45 million pounds ($80 million) compared with loss of 200 million pounds year earlier; full-year income rose 70 percent, to 230 million pounds ($407 million); chief executive Rod Eddington wa...", "lead_paragraph": "British Airways reported fourth-quarter pretax profit of \u00a345 million ($80 million), in contrast to a loss of \u00a3200 million a year earlier.
