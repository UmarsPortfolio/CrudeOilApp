For two hours each way, the man who once supplied 2 percent of the world\u2019s oil crouches in a steel cage measuring 47 by 31 by 20 inches.

In the dark of the van, Khodorkovsky tries to prepare for his trial, replaying in his mind his night reading, the daily stack of documents from his lawyers. But Russia\u2019s most famous prisoner worries too about what would happen if a car slammed into the van.

Converting the airline industry to biofuels may be easier than converting the car market. ) The scheduled flight on Wednesday of a Continental Airlines 737 fueled in part by biofuels made from jatropha and algae was experimental (see my report on the state of biofuels in the airline industry from Wednesday's paper here). But if the fuel can be certified by international standards agencies, it could become as common as, say, ethanol added to gasoline.   It might be even more so, because the goal is a \"drop-in\" substitute that can be used at any percentage, in any jet or any airport fueling system.  In theory, people in the industry say, replacing petroleum in airplanes could be easier than replacing it in cars, even though jet fuel has to meet specifications that are of little concern on the highway, like weight (hauling fuel is a major use of fuel, after all), or how well it flows at 40 degrees below zero, which is a temperature big planes face for hours as they cruise in the stratosphere.   Because fuel quality has such importance to safety, some energy experts thought aviation would be the last to switch. \"For 40 years we had the philosophy we'd be the ones using the last drop of oil,'' said Carl E. Burleson, director of the Federal Aviation Administration's Office of Environment and Energy.  But compared to the market for gasoline or diesel, the market for jet fuel is simpler, industry experts say.     The number of fueling stations and customers are both much smaller than for motor vehicle fuel, making marketing easier. The number of engine manufacturers is smaller, too, so there are fewer parties to convince when switching to something new. And unlike the specifications for gasoline, which vary from state to state and country to country, there is a single standard for jet fuel, regardless of where it is sold.   As with substitute motor fuels, though, substitute jet fuel has mixed environmental implications. European carriers have tested fuel made from palm oil, but recent studies have persuaded some environmentalists that clearing tropical jungle to make space for palm plantations is a mistake, releasing more greenhouse gases than the new fuel will save. And the only petroleum substitute in common use now is made from coal, a switch that can save money and petroleum but makes greenhouse gas problems worse.   The precise carbon effect of using algae, jatropha or other substitutes will be studied closely and probably litigated, because airlines say they want to use such fuels to meet European regulations taking effect in the next few years, which will force them to cut carbon output or buy carbon allowances.

(Photo: Reuters)) Physics met politics at the confirmation hearing Tuesday for Steven Chu, the Nobel laureate scientist chosen by President-elect Obama to head the Department of Energy.   Mr. Chu backed away slightly from statements made in his last job, as director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, that gasoline prices should be higher, and that coal was his \"nightmare.\"   Mr. Chu, who got a very friendly welcome from the committee on Energy and Natural Resources, said that \"last year's rapid spike in oil and gasoline prices not only contributed to the recession we are now experiencing, it also put a huge strain on the budgets of families all across America.''  Last September he told The Wall Street Journal, \"Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe.\" In answer to a question about that statement, he said, \"What the American family does not want is to pay an increasing fraction of their budget, their precious dollars, for energy costs, both in transportation and keeping their homes warm and lit.''  The answer is efficiency, he said.  He also said that coal, which has a wide political constituency, would continue to be used, and that the trick was to convert it to electricity cleanly.  Mr. Chu answered an array of questions about his position on new nuclear reactors (yes, at least for a few plants), offshore drilling (only as part of an energy package) and new coal-burning power plants (a few, until we figure out a better way). He referred frequently to positions taken by President-elect Obama. But he really warmed up when Blanch Lincoln, a senator from Arkansas, asked him about how plants could be turned into substitutes for petroleum.    \"Actually, now we're getting to science, I love this,'' he said, to laugher around the room. He described how he has supervised research to figure out, \"How do you break those plants down into the kind of sugars these little critters, the yeast and bacteria, can actually use?'' Gene-altered bacteria have been developed to turn sugar into substitutes for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, he said.  Several senators reiterated the idea that the Energy Department faced terrific scientific challenges, and that a Nobel physicist was the appropriate person to head it. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who introduced him to the committee, referred to him as \"one of the great, brilliant thinkers of his generation.''   In the course of the hearing, the main mission of the Energy Department \u2013 making, maintaining and dismantling nuclear weapons, and cleaning up from six decades of nuclear weapon production \u2013 got intermittent mention.   According to Stephen I. Schwartz, author of a report on nuclear weapons spending sponsored by the Carnegie Endowment, the budget for nuclear weapons in 2008 was over $52 billion. Robert Alvarez, who served as a policy advisor to the energy secretary in the Clinton administration, said that the Energy Department is spending about 11 times more money on nuclear weapons than on energy conservation.  If confirmed, Mr. Chu faces a variety of conflicting mandates. For example, he said that using more renewable energy is a national priority and thus will require a national electric grid. To help create such a grid, a 2005 law gives the Energy Department the authority to designate high-priority corridors, to overrule local objections to new power lines. But Senator Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, complained that the Energy Department had designated his entire state as part of a corridor.   Mr. Chu promised to investigate.  Another problem is nuclear waste. Mr. Chu repeatedly said that of the carbon-free power generation in this country, 70 percent is nuclear. But Mr. Obama has expressed deep skepticism about the plan to bury nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, the site near Las Vegas that the government has worked for 20 years to develop. A solution would have to be found, he said, but construction of new plants should resume now, after a hiatus of 30 years, even before the solution is developed.
