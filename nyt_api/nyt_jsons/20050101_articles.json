Lately, a trend in personal finance articles seems to be about a supposed bubble in the prices of energy stocks.     The theory goes like this: energy stocks are at the high end of their 52-week cycle. Some are at their highest points ever.

But with the fund teetering toward insolvency, state officials must find a solution or risk losing $1 billion in federal transportation aid that is allocated to match state contributions.
