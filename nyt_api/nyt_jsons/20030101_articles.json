Berkshire, the company run by the investor Warren E. Buffett, bought $255 million of Seitel's senior, unsecured notes this year. Seitel's shareholders had challenged the prepackaged plan that Seitel brought with it to bankruptcy protection. Under that plan, Berkshire, which is based in Omaha, was supposed to get control of Seitel, which is based in Houston, and the shareholders would have received $10.1 million, or about 40 cents a share. Instead, Berkshire and Ranch Capital, which also bought prebankruptcy debt, will be paid off under a plan to be detailed in papers filed with the court before a Jan. 30 hearing.", "print_section": "C", "print_page": "4", "source": "The New York Times", "multimedia": [], "headline": {"main": "SEITEL INVESTORS END BUYOUT PLAN BY BUFFETT", "kicker": "COMPANY NEWS", "content_kicker": null, "print_headline": "COMPANY NEWS; SEITEL INVESTORS END BUYOUT PLAN BY BUFFETT", "name": null, "seo": null, "sub": null}, "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "SEITEL INC", "rank": 1, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "RANCH CAPITAL", "rank": 2, "major": "N"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "Berkshire Hathaway Inc", "rank": 3, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "rank": 4, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline", "rank": 5, "major": "N"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "Bankruptcies", "rank": 6, "major": "N"}], "pub_date": "2003-12-30T05:00:00+0000", "document_type": "article", "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "section_name": "Business Day", "byline": {"original": "By Dow Jones; Ap", "person": [{"firstname": "Dow", "middlename": null, "lastname": "Jones", "qualifier": null, "title": null, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "rank": 1}], "organization": null}, "type_of_material": "News", "_id": "nyt://article/35d3e021-a90a-5103-b3b0-684c0e41394d", "word_count": 136, "uri": "nyt://article/35d3e021-a90a-5103-b3b0-684c0e41394d"}, {"abstract": "Itochu Corp and Taiyo Oil Co buy $24.4 milion of shares in South Korean oil refiner SK Corp in move that may help company fend off possible hostile takeover by Sovereign Asset Management; two companies purchase combined 0.74 percent stake in company; graph (S)", "web_url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/27/business/world-business-briefing-asia-japan-refiner-raises-funds.html", "snippet": "Itochu Corp and Taiyo Oil Co buy $24.4 milion of shares in South Korean oil refiner SK Corp in move that may help company fend off possible hostile takeover by Sovereign Asset Management; two companies purchase combined 0.74 percent stake in compa...", "lead_paragraph": "The Itochu Corporation of Japan and the Taiyo Oil Company bought $24.4 million of shares in the SK Corporation, South Korea's largest oil refiner, in a move that may help the company fend off a possible hostile takeover by Sovereign Asset Management, investors said.
